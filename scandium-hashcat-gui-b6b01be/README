hashcat-gui is a graphical user interface for the hashcat tools "hashcat",
"oclHashcat-plus" and "oclHashcat-lite" available at http://hashcat.net/

This project is hosted at https://github.com/scandium/hashcat-gui/

It merely acts as a command line generator and starts the appropriate hashcat
executable with certain parameters. It does not include any source code from hashcat
itself or link against any hashcat libraries.
