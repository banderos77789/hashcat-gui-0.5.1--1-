To build hashcat-gui either

1. Download the Qt SDK from http://qt-project.org/
2. Open hashcat-gui.pro in Qt Creator
3. Click "Run"

OR

1. Download the Qt libraries from http://qt-project.org/
2. Build the Qt libraries:

	[Windows using Microsoft Windows SDK]
	setenv /release /[x86/x64]
	configure -release [-static]
	nmake sub-src

	[Linux]
	./configure -release [-static]
	make

	Use "-static" if you want to statically link Qt into hashcat-gui, you can
	run the hashcat-gui executable without having any Qt libraries around then.
	This is how hashcat-gui releases available on the hashcat website are built.

3. Build hashcat-gui: qmake -config release && make
