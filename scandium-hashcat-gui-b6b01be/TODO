If you implement any of these features please remove it
from this list and in case it was suggested by someone
else give proper credit in the ChangeLog file!

- rework layout: over time so many options have been added and the GUI started
to mostly grow in height instead of width taking up too much vertical screen space

- All file chooser dialogs: save last folder (suggested by boris_)

- remember hardware device choice (suggested by K9_)

- restore settings on restart (suggested by K9_)

- make path to hashcat directory configurable

- export current settings with ability to important them again (suggested by teamakg)

- quick paste hashes (suggested by blandyuk)

- allow terminal to be configurable to allow more than just the currently
hardcoded terminal

- oclHashcat-lite has different maximum password lengths depending on the
hash type. The GUI should dynamically change the maximum allowed value
for that field depending on the currently selected hash type.
(see oclHashcat-lite "changes v0.05 -> v0.06" for a list)

- oclHashcat-plus: integrate hccap converter for WPA2 into the GUI.
See if we can use the converter inside the GUI using an appropriate
http request instead of just opening the web page

- remove code duplication: There are currently a few copy&paste code
structures that could easily be made cleaner and more robust by refactoring them
